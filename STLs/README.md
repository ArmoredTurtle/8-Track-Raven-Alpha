## Material choice
PLA, PETG and ABS have been tested, all work however PETG is not recommended for extruder parts or drop plates.
When using heated inserts, be sure to use appropriate temperatures for your selected material.

## Part call out!
Guidler: same settings with 6 perimeters and 40% infill

Servo_Arm: Same as guidler unless pla. If in PLA print at 100% infill.

6-1Hub: Increase infill to 20% to ensure proper support of filament paths.
